0. Add support for directories
   - I think the way to go here is to create an in-memory tarball of whatever directory the 
     client is looking for and transmit info that way
   - To make this as unassuming as possible, I'll send the tarball without any sort of compression.
1. Add support for multiple files (e.g. "python client.py <options> file [file...]")
